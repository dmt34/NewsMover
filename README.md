NewsMover
=========

The Sitecore News Mover project provides an event handler to relocate items based on a date field. 

Module to enable dynamic folder creation for date based items (such as news articles) in a Sitecore tree. Originally created by John West. Jimmie Overby then improved the configuration model among other changes and uploaded it to GitHub. Finally, I forked it to fix some issues as noted in release notes.
