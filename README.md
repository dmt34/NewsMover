NewsMover
=========

The Sitecore News Mover project provides an event handler to relocate items based on a date field. 

Module to enable dynamic folder creation for date based items (such as news articles) in a Sitecore tree. Originally created by John West. Jimmie Overby then improved the configuration model among other changes and uploaded it to GitHub. Finally, I forked it to fix some issues as noted in release notes.

## v2.3 update
Added functionality to relocate items based on item name (or a text field on the item). It dynamically creates folder items named with the first letter of the item name. I "borrowed" a good bit of the code from https://github.com/yogeshsharma1990/NewsMover but then refactored a bunch. Refactored namespaces to be more logical.
